; NAME:
;     TVIMAGE
;
; PURPOSE:
;     This purpose of TVIMAGE is to allow you to display an image
;     on the display or in a PostScript file in a particular position.
;     The position is specified by means of the POSITION keyword. In
;     this respect, TVIMAGE works like other IDL graphics commands.
;     Moreover, the TVIMAGE command works identically on the display
;     and in a PostScript file. You don't have to worry about how to
;     "size" the image in PostScript. The output on your display and
;     in the PostScript file will be identical. The major advantage of
;     TVIMAGE is that it can be used in a natural way with other IDL
;     graphics commands in resizeable IDL graphics windows. TVIMAGE
;     is a replacement for TV and assumes the image has been scaled
;     correctly when it is passed as an argument.

; CATEGORY:
;     Graphics display.
;
; CALLING SEQUENCE:
;
;     TVIMAGE, image
;
; INPUTS:
;     image:    A 2D or 3D image array. It should be byte data.
;
; KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
;     ERASE:    If this keyword is set an ERASE command is issued
;               before the image is displayed. Note that the ERASE
;               command puts the image on a new page in PostScript
;               output.
;
;     _EXTRA:   This keyword picks up any TV keywords you wish to use.
;
;     KEEP_ASPECT_RATIO: Normally, the image will be resized to fit the
;               specified position in the window. If you prefer, you can
;               force the image to maintain its aspect ratio in the window
;               (although not its natural size) by setting this keyword.
;               The image width is fitted first. If, after setting the
;               image width, the image height is too big for the window,
;               then the image height is fitted into the window. The
;               appropriate values of the POSITION keyword are honored
;               during this fitting process. Once a fit is made, the
;               POSITION coordiates are re-calculated to center the image
;               in the window. You can recover these new position coordinates
;               as the output from the POSITION keyword.
;
;     MARGIN:   A single value, expressed as a normalized coordinate, that
;               can easily be used to calculate a position in the window.
;               The margin is used to calculate a POSITION that gives
;               the image an equal margin around the edge of the window.
;               The margin must be a number in the range 0.0 to 0.333. This
;               keyword is ignored if the POSITION keyword is used.
;
;     MINUS_ONE: The value of this keyword is passed along to the CONGRID
;               command. It prevents CONGRID from adding an extra row and
;               column to the resulting array, which can be a problem with
;               small image arrays.
;
;     POSITION: The location of the image in the output window. This is
;               a four-element floating array of normalized coordinates of
;               the type given by !P.POSITION or the POSITION keyword to
;               other IDL graphics commands. The form is [x0, y0, x1, y1].
;               The default is [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0]. Note that this can
;               be an output parameter if the KEEP_ASPECT_RATIO keyword is
;               used.
;
; OUTPUTS:
;     None.
;
; SIDE EFFECTS:
;     Unless the KEEP_ASPECT_RATIO keyword is set, the displayed image
;     may not have the same aspect ratio as the input data set.
;
; RESTRICTIONS:
;     If the POSITION keyword and the KEEP_ASPECT_RATIO keyword are
;     used together, there is an excellent chance the POSITION
;     parameters will change. If the POSITION is passed in as a
;     variable, the new positions will be returned as an output parameter.
;
;     If the image is 2D then color decomposition is turned OFF
;     for the current graphics device (i.e., DEVICE, DECOMPOSED=0).
;
;     If outputting to the PRINTER device, the aspect ratio of the image
;     is always maintained and the POSITION coordinates are ignored.
;     The image always printed in portrait mode.
;
; EXAMPLE:
;     To display an image with a contour plot on top of it, type:
;
;        filename = FILEPATH(SUBDIR=['examples','data'], 'worldelv.dat')
;        image = BYTARR(360,360)
;        OPENR, lun, filename, /GET_LUN
;        READU, image
;        FREE_LUN, lun
;
;        TVIMAGE, image, POSITION=thisPosition, /KEEP_ASPECT_RATIO
;        CONTOUR, image, POSITION=thisPosition, /NOERASE, XSTYLE=1, $
;            YSTYLE=1, XRANGE=[0,360], YRANGE=[0,360], NLEVELS=10
;
; MODIFICATION HISTORY:
;      Written by:     David Fanning, 20 NOV 1996.
;      Fixed a small bug with the resizing of the image. 17 Feb 1997. DWF.
;      Removed BOTTOM and NCOLORS keywords. This reflects my growing belief
;         that this program should act more like TV and less like a "color
;         aware" application. I leave "color awareness" to the program
;         using TVIMAGE. Added 24-bit image capability. 15 April 1997. DWF.
;      Fixed a small bug that prevented this program from working in the
;          Z-buffer. 17 April 1997. DWF.
;      Fixed a subtle bug that caused me to think I was going crazy!
;          Lession learned: Be sure you know the *current* graphics
;          window! 17 April 1997. DWF.
;      Added support for the PRINTER device. 25 June 1997. DWF.
;      Extensive modifications. 27 Oct 1997. DWF
;          1) Removed PRINTER support, which didn't work as expected.
;          2) Modified Keep_Aspect_Ratio code to work with POSITION keyword.
;          3) Added check for window-able devices (!D.Flags AND 256).
;          4) Modified PostScript color handling.
;      Craig Markwart points out that Congrid adds an extra row and column
;          onto an array. When viewing small images (e.g., 20x20) this can be
;          a problem. Added a Minus_One keyword whose value can be passed
;          along to the Congrid keyword of the same name. 28 Oct 1997. DWF
;      Changed default POSITION to fill entire window. 30 July 1998. DWF.
;      Made sure color decomposition is OFF for 2D images. 6 Aug 1998. DWF.
;      Added limited PRINTER portrait mode support. The correct aspect ratio
;          of the image is always maintained when outputting to the
;          PRINTER device and POSITION coordinates are ignored. 6 Aug 1998. DWF
;      Removed 6 August 98 fixes (Device, Decomposed=0) after realizing that
;          they interfere with operation in the Z-graphics buffer. 9 Oct 1998. DWF
;      Added a MARGIN keyword. 18 Oct 1998. DWF.
;      Re-established Device, Decomposed=0 keyword for devices that
;         support it. 18 Oct 1998. DWF.
